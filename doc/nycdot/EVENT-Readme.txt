README.txt

This Readme.txt file documents the contents of the NYC CVPD Project's EVENT 
record types.  Each EVENT record documents the details of one application 
warning that occurred on an Aftermarket Safety Device (ASD) in an equipped host 
vehicle and includes CV messages from a defined recording time both before and 
after the warning was generated by the host ASD.  Messages in the recording 
time window include the Basic Safety Messages (BSM) of the host vehicle that 
received the warning, as well as other BSMs received from the warning target 
equipped vehicle (for V2V applications) or other nearby equipped vehicles.  
Depending on the application warning type, MAP messages, Signal Phase and 
Timing (SPaT) messages, and Traveler Information Messages (TIM) that were heard 
by the host vehicle may also be included in the event record.  

Each EVENT record is based on the MSG_NycCvpdEvent message type documented in 
the “NYC CVPD Event Format (10 05 2020)_v2.0.pdf”.  However, the EVENT records 
which have been shared by the NYC CVPD team have undergone obfuscation of 
precise time and location details as well as other vehicle identifiers that 
were determined to be potential threats to the privacy prior to the release.

Additionally, the BSM, MAP, SPaT, and TIM messages contained in the obfuscated 
EVENT records generally follow the SAE J2735 structures.  However, some data 
elements in the J2735 standard have been removed, transformed, or modified to 
preserve the privacy of the CVPD participant drivers and vehicle operators.  

Details of these changes are documented in the DataProcessing.txt file.
