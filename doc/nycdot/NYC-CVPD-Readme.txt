The New York City (NYC) Connected Vehicle (CV) Pilot Deployment project has 
installed Aftermarket Safety Devices (ASD) in a number of NYC fleet vehicles. 
The data in this repository provides a view of the NYC CV Pilot system 
performance, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) 
interactions, and operation of the CV applications.  The data collection 
occurred during 2021 under Phase 3: Operate and Maintain of USDOT Agreement 
Number DTFH6116H00026.

While the data is collected daily, the accuracy, age, and completeness of the 
data are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.

The following sub-directory provides documentation on the repository's content 
of EVENT records collected via the Onboard Units (OBU) also known as 
Aftermarket Safety Devices (ASD).  The data set is updated weekly.
