Dataprocessing.txt file for the NYC CVPD EVENT dataset.

The released EVENT records have undergone obfuscation of time, location, and 
vehicle-specific identifying data elements that were originally contained 
within the raw field collected records.  

Details of the need for the obfuscation process can be found in the Performance 
Measurement and Evaluation Support Plan Report for the NYC CVPD project, as 
published at https://www.its.dot.gov/pilots/cv_pubs.htm

Additionally, since precise time and location is not revealed in the released 
EVENT records, additional data documenting the general operational environment 
at the time the CV application warning was generated is added (when available) 
to eventHeader.

The general contents of the EVENT record include:
   1) eventHeader: A DF_EventHeader dataframe
   2) bsmList:     Sequence of DF_BSMEvent dataframes
   3) mapList:     Sequence of DF_MAPEvent dataframes
   4) spatList:    Sequence of DF_SPaTEvent dataframes
   5) timList:     Sequence of DF_TIMEvent dataframes

The raw field collected records followed the MSG_NycCvpdEvent message type as 
documented in the “NYC CVPD Event Format (10 05 2020)_v2.0.pdf”.  The following 
information provides details on the removal, modification, or obfuscation of 
the data elements from those raw field formats prior to the EVENT record being 
released and shared via this repository.

A major element of the modifications relates to the obfuscation of the true 
time and location of the event warnings.  The following discusses the changes 
made throughout the EVENT file message contents.

Time Obfuscation:
All time elements in all messages are shifted to a time frame with units of 
seconds.  The definition of time 0.000 seconds is the moment the ASD issued the 
CV application warning to the host vehicle's driver.  All other time elements 
included in the BSMs and other messages are translated accordingly to this new 
event-based time scale.

Location Obfuscation:
All real-world latitude/longitude/elevation coordinates are removed and replaced 
by an artificial X,Y,Z coordinate system with units of meters.  The point 
(0,0,0) is set to be equal to the coordinates of the host vehicle's BSM that 
trigger the application to issue the warning.  All other real-world coordinates 
are likewise transcribed and translated to this new artificial coordinate 
system.

Changes to DF_eventHeader dataframe contents:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-The eventTimeStamp data element has been removed
-The asdSerialNumber data element has been removed
-The following new data elements are added to the eventHeader:
    -eventStatus:  Value is always “Obfuscated” for released EVENT records
    -eventTimeBin:  String in the format “YYYY-MM-DAY-TP" to provide some 
        details of when the event took place, where:
        YYYY is the year (e.g. “2021”)
        MM is the month in number format (e.g. “05”)
        DAY is the day of the week (e.g. “TUE”) in a 3-character
            abbreviation.  The value “N/A” may also appear as an
            additional level of obfuscation.
        TP is the time period of the day.  The value can be one of:
            “NT”: Night (12-6am)
            “AM”: Morning (6-10am)
            “MD”: Midday (10am-3pm)
            “PM”: Afternoon (3-8pm)
            “EV”: Evening (8pm-12am)
            “N/A”: Unspecified time of day. 
        It is noted that the "N/A" values are only used when the quantities of
        events with a common eventType, eventLocationBin, and eventTimeBin are 
        limited and additional time obfuscation is required prior to the EVENT 
        record being released.
    -eventLocationBin:  String of the format “XX-YY-ZZZ”, to provide 
        some details on where in NYC the event took place, where:
        XX is either:
            "CV" when the roadway is near an RSU,
            "NY" when not near an RSU
        YY is a 2-character abbreviation of the NYC borough:
            "BK": Brooklyn
            "BX": The Bronx
            "MN": Manhattan
            "QN": Queens
            "SI": Staten Island
        ZZZ provides insights into the road type where the event occurred:
            "1wayAve": One-way Avenue in Manhattan
            "2wayAve": Two-way Avenue in Manhattan
            "1waySt":  One-way Street in Manhattan
            "2waySt":  Two-way Street in Manhattan
            "Fwy":  A freeway, parkway, or otherwise controlled access roadway
            "Art":  An arterial roadway
            "Oth":  Other, generally collector or local level roadways
        Note when the event occurred outside of the NYC city limits, the code
        "nonNYC" is used as the entire entry for the eventLocationBin.  
        It is also noted that the eventLocationBin entry may have a value of 
        "N/A" when the quantities of events with a common eventType, 
        eventLocationBin, and eventTimeBin are limited and additional location
        time obfuscation is required prior to the EVENT record being released.
    -weatherCondition:  String describing of the weather conditions (from NWS)
    -airTemperature:  Integer, in degrees Fahrenheit 
    -precipitation1Hr: String, inches of precipitation in last hour; "M" 
        indicates data is not available
    -windSpeed: Integer, wind speed (knots)
    -speedCondition:  Integer, miles per hour.  Average speed (mph) of the 
        roadway where the event occurred, as provided by non-CV pilot based 
        speed monitoring systems available.  Note that the average speed is 
        reported for roadway segments which can be a mile or more in length; 
        and may not truly represent the localized speeds on the roadway when 
        the EVENT record was generated.  When average roadway speed 
        information is not available, this data element is omitted.
    -lastPlowed:  Integer, minutes.  Time (rounded to 5 minute values) since a 
        snow plow last was seen on the roadway where the event occurred.  Data 
        included is as provided by the city's snow plow tracking and reporting 
        system.  A value of -1 indicates that snow plows were active in the 
        city at the time of the event, but a snow plow has not yet travelled on 
        the roadway where the event occurred.  When the city's snow plow 
        tracking and reporting system is not active, this data element is 
        omitted.
Other elements of the eventHeader remain unchanged and adhere to the EVENT 
format documentation.  The following notes are provided for additional insights
and guidance on the EVENT records:
    -eventType:  the CV application which triggered the warning. One of:
        -bsw:  Blind Spot Warning (V2V)
        -eebl: Emergency Electronic Brake Lights (V2V)
        -fcw:  Forward Crash Warning (V2V)
        -ima:  Intersection Movement Assist (V2V)
        -lcw:  Lane Change Warning (V2V)
        -vtrw: Vehicle Turning Right Warning (V2V) 
        -cspdomp:    Curve speed compliance (V2I)
        -evacinfo:   Emergency Communications and Evacuation Information (V2I)
        -ovcclearancelimit:  Oversize Vehicle Compliance (V2I)
        -pedinxwalk: Pedestrian in Signalized Crosswalk Warning (V2I)
        -rlvw:       Red Light Violation Warning (V2I)
        -spdcomp:    Speed Compliance (V2I)
        -spdcompwz:  Speed Compliance in Work Zone(V2I)
        See https://cvp.nyc/cv-safety-apps for details.
    -parameters:  The set of parameters contain configuration parameters which 
        help define how the ASD applications operate and how data is recorded.  
        It is noted that which parameters are included vary based on the CV 
        application warning type that the EVENT record is documenting.
    -locationSource:  Provides details on which method the location of the host 
        vehicle was determined.  Note this parameter is only meaningful in 
        ASD firmware versions 4.3 or higher.  Values can include:
            -gpsrsu: location is determined through a combination of GSP GNSS 
                sensors, vehicle speed and yaw rate, and triangulation to 
                nearby RSUs configured to broadcast V2XLocate details to ASDs.
            -gps: location is determined through a combination of GSP GNSS 
                sensors, vehicle speed and yaw rate.
            -directgps: location is determined by GPS GNSS sensors only.  Note 
                in this location mode, BSM transmissions are halted as location 
                is not know precisely enough for safety applications, and no 
                event warnings should be issued.
    -asdFirmwareVersion:  The firmware running on the ASD at the time of the 
        recorded event.
    -eventAlertSent:  Did the CV application determine if conditions warrant 
        that a warning should be issued?  Boolean
    -eventAlertActive:  Did the ASD deliver the warning to the driver? Boolean.
        True if the audible alert was issued, False if the alert was not 
        issued (if ASD is configured for pre-deployment conditions or if the
        vehicle is part of the control group which does not received warnings).
    -eventAlertHeard:  Did the ASD detect that the alert was heard or detected.
        Boolean.
    -hostVehID:  Temporary ID of the host vehicle at the time of the warning.
    -targetVehID:  Temporary ID of the target vehicle at the time of the 
        warning.  Valid only for V2V applications.
    -triggerHVSeqNum:  Sequence number of the host vehicle's BSM which 
        triggered the warning that was issued.  Refers to the MsgSeqNum in the 
        list of BSM records contained in the EVENT record.
    -triggerTVSeqNum:  Sequence number of the target vehicle's BSM which 
        triggered the warning that was issued.  Refers to the MsgSeqNum in the 
        list of BSM records contained in the EVENT record.  Valid only for V2V 
        applications.
    -grpId:  Integer representing the group to which the vehicle is assigned.  
        ID <= 19: Pilot test vehicles.  Vehicles used by the pilot team for ASD
            testing purposes throughout the pilot.
        ID  = 20: Control group vehicle.  Vehicles assigned to the control
            group operate in 'silent' mode throughout the deployment.  ASDs 
            should not deliver warnings to the drivers, but will still record 
            EVENTS when applications determine a warning condition exists.
        ID >= 21: Treatment group vehicle.  Vehicles assigned to the treatment
            group will all operate in 'silent' mode for the before deployment 
            data collection period.  At the start of the after or live 
            deployment, all treatment vehicles will transition to 'active' 
            mode, and start to deliver application warning messages to the 
            drivers. 

Changes to DF_BSMEvent dataframe contents
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contents of the field collected BSM messages are modified as followed when 
included in the obfuscated EVENT records:

BSM data elements removed or modified are:
    -secMark
    -lat
    -long
    -elev
    -speed
    -heading
    -accelSet elements
    -crumbData elements (in partII)
BSM data elements added or modified are:
    -T_s:  Replaces the secMark element to represent time.  T_s values are 
        float values in seconds, with a time of 0.000 seconds being the time
        at which the event warning was delivered.  Negative T_s values indicate
        BSMs prior to the warning, while positive T_s values are after the 
        warning was issued.
    -X_m:  Replaces the long element.  Values are floats in meters, with X_m 
        of 0.000 being the X coordinate of the host vehicle's BSM which 
        triggered the warning to be issued.  Values may be positive or negative.
    -Y_m:  Replaces the lat element.  Values are floats in meters, with Y_m 
        of 0.000 being the Y coordinate of the host vehicle's BSM which 
        triggered the warning to be issued.  Values may be positive or negative.
    -Z_m:  Replaces the elev element.  Values are floats in meters, with Z_m 
        of 0.000 being the Z coordinate of the host vehicle's BSM which 
        triggered the warning to be issued.  Values may be positive or negative.
    -speed_mps:  Replaces the speed element.  Values are float values 
        with units of meters per second.
    -heading_deg:  Replaces the heading element.  Values are floats with units
        of degrees in the range of 0.000 to 359.999.  A heading of zero is due 
        north, 90 is due east, 180 due south, and 270 due east.
    -accelSet:  The accelSet element remains, but the standard components of 
        long, lat, vert, and yaw are replace with long_mpss, lat_mpss, 
        vert_mpss, and yaw_dps respectively.  All new elements are float values, 
        with the units of long_mpss, lat_mpss, and vert_mpss being meters per 
        second per second, and the units of yaw_dps being degrees per second.
    -crumbData:  The crumbData in the BSMs remains, but the elements of 
        latOffset, longOffset, elevationOffset, and timeOffset are replaced with
        yOffset_m, xOffset_m, zOffset_m, and tOffset_s.  All new elements are 
        float values with the units of meters for yOffset_m, xOffset_m, and 
        zOffset_m, while units for tOffset_t in seconds.
All other BSM components are unchanged from the EVENT formats in the provided 
PDF.
   
    
Changes to DF_MAPEvent dataframe contents
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contents of the field collected MAP messages are modified as followed when 
included in the obfuscated EVENT records:

MAP message data elements removed or modified are:
    -msgIssueRevision:  This element is removed and not replaced.
    -id:  The intersection id data element remains, but is replace by an generic
        letter code (e.g. A, B, C, ...) instead of the true intersection ID.  
    -revision:  The intersection revision data element is removed and not 
        replaced.
    -refPoint: The intersection refPoint element remains, but the sub-elements 
        of lat, long, and elevation are replaced with X_m, Y_m, and Z_m.  Each
        of these new refPoint elements are floats with units in meters.  All 
        real-world coordinates are converted and translated to the same 
        artificial coordinate system developed for the event's BSM location 
        data, where the host vehicle's event trigger BSM is placed at the 
        (0,0,0) coordinate.
    -speed:  The intersection speedLimit element speed is removed and replaced 
        with the new element speed_mps.  The value is a float value with the 
        units of meters per second.

The number of MAP messages is also trimmed from the raw field collected EVENT
records.  All duplicated MAP messages heard by the host vehicle are removed to 
reduce redundant data in the obfuscated EVENT record, and the MAP messages 
which may be heard by the host vehicle but are not located near the EVENT 
record BSM data points are removed. 

All other MAP message components are unchanged from the EVENT formats in the 
provided PDF, including all laneSet NodeXY delta objects.

Changes to DF_TIMEvent dataframe contents
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contents of the field collected TIM messages are modified as followed when 
included in the obfuscated EVENT records:

TIM message data elements removed or modified are:
    -packetID:  the packetID element is retained, but the true packetID is 
        replaced with a generic letter code (e.g. A, B, C, ...).
    -position:  the roadSignID position information (lat, long, elevation) is 
        removed and is not replaced.
    -startYear:  this element is removed and not replaced.
    -startTime:  this element is removed and not replaced.
    -durationTime:  this element is removed and not replaced.
    -regions:   this entire element, including all sub-elements, is removed and 
        not replaced with any obfuscated version of that data.
        
The number of TIM messages is also trimmed from the raw field collected EVENT
records, as all duplicated MAP messages heard by the host vehicle are removed
and only one copy is included in the obfuscated EVENT record.

All other TIM message components are unchanged from the EVENT formats in the 
provided PDF.

Changes to DF_SPATEvent dataframe contents
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contents of the field collected SPaT messages are modified as followed when 
included in the obfuscated EVENT records:

SPaT message data elements removed or modified are:
    -timeStamp (message):  the MinuteOfYear time element from the SPaT message 
        header is removed.  Time details are retained within the individual 
        intersection details within the body of the SPaT message.
    -id:  the intersection ID data element remains, but the intersection ID 
        value from the raw field data is removed and replaced with a generic 
        letter code (e.g. A, B, C, ...).  It is noted that this letter code 
        is modified consistently with the replacement of the intersection id 
        for MAP data.  This allows obfuscated MAP and SPaT data from the same 
        intersection to still be linked together with a common ID letter code.
    -timeStamp (intersection):  the timeStamp element within each intersection 
        is removed and replaced with the time_sec data element.  The value of 
        time_sec is a float value with units of seconds.  The new obfuscated 
        time_sec values use the same time scale as the obfuscated BSMs (where 
        the event warning was issued at time=0.000).  Negative values indicate 
        SPaT messages heard prior to the warning and postive values indicate 
        SPaT messages heard after the warning
    -state-time-speed Time Elements:  The minEndTime, maxEndTime, likelyTime, 
        and nextTime elements in the signalGroup's timing details are removed 
        and replaced with minEndTime_s, maxEndTime_s, likelyTime_s, 
        and nextTime_s respectively.  The meanings of the elements remain the 
        same as those in the J2735 standard, but the values are changed to float
        values with a unit of seconds, and are transformed into the same event 
        specific time scale as the BSMs (event warning issued at time=0.000).

All other SPaT message components are unchanged from the EVENT formats in the 
provided PDF.
